      <p>Another key benefit of using ESD for your electrical blueprint analysis is the potential to significantly reduce the costs associated with manual data extraction and processing. By automating many of the labor intensive and time consuming tasks involved in symbol recognition and labeling, ESD can help you lower your operating expenses, increase your profitability, and reinvest your savings into other areas of your business.</p>
      <p>The Cost Reduction section of the Analytics dashboard in ESD provides a range of metrics and tools to help you quantify and optimize the financial benefits of our platform. Here, you can track and analyze data such as:</p>
