            <li>You may not use, reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, republish, download, store, or transmit any third party content on the ESD platform, except as expressly permitted by the respective third party licensor or with their prior written consent.</li>

            <li>If you are a copyright owner, or authorized on behalf of one, and you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please submit your claim via email to <a href="mailto:copyright@esd.one">copyright@esd.one</a>, with the subject line: "DMCA Takedown Request". You must include in your claim a detailed description of the alleged infringement.</li>

            <li>If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code ยง1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>At ESD, we are committed to fostering a platform that respects and protects the intellectual property rights of all parties involved. We believe that by working together and following these guidelines, we can create a vibrant and innovative ecosystem for electrical blueprint analysis while minimizing the risk of intellectual property infringement.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our intellectual property policies or procedures, please don't hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@esd.one">legal@esd.one</a>. We are always happy to discuss these important issues and work towards mutually beneficial solutions.</p>
